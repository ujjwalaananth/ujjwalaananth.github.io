I am a Machine Learning Engineer at Amazon Alexa
where I work on developing content moderation models for Alexa Large Language Models (LLM) as well 
as research on mitigating security vulnerabilities (such as prompt injection attacks) on large action models (LAMs).
I completed my MS in Information Technology from The Polytechnic School, Arizona State University. 
I was a research volunteer working with Prof. [Chitta Baral](https://www.public.asu.edu/~cbaral/) and Prof. [Paulo Shakarian](https://search.asu.edu/profile/2424157). 
I closely collaborate with Dr. [Swaroop Mishra](https://swarooprm.github.io/) and Dr. [Arindam Mitra](https://ari9dam.github.io/). 
My research interests are Efficient Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM Alignment, Augment LLM Reasoning and RAGs.
I am also exploring vision language research.

Research
======
My research interests include LLM Reasoning, LLM Security, Instruction Tuning, Creation & Curation of Benchmarks, 
Preference Optimization and Model Efficiency. 
My strength lies in generating new ideas, and I am fortunate to collaborate with a diverse set of awesome researchers.
